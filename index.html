        <h4>About Us</h4>
        <p>During the last 59 years Bharati Vidyapeeth has made astonishing strides in the field of education, particularly, higher and professional education. Today Bharati Vidyapeeth conducts more than 156 educational units of various kindsâ€™ right from pre-primary schools to postgraduate institutions and a full fledged professional university (BVDU).
          Today, Bharati Vidyapeeth has its major campuses in New Delhi, Navi Mumbai, Pune, Solapur, Kolhapur, Sangli, Karad, Satara, and Panchgani and at quite a few other places. Bharati Vidyapeeth is probably the only organization from Maharashtra having its campus in the capital city of India. It is not in the urban areas alone that Bharati Vidyapeeth has started its institutions. Its schools and colleges have dotted rural areas and even the remotest tribal and coastal areas of Maharashtra.
         Bharati Vidyapeeth runs more than 78 schools and 60 institutions of higher education, including those of professional education. Among these are colleges of Medicine, Dentistry, Ayurved, Homeopathy, Nursing, Pharmacy, Law, Biotechnology, Engineering, Management, Hotel Management & Catering Technology, Environment Science, Agriculture, Physical education and more. With a view to promote research activities and to create a research culture on its campuses, Bharati Vidyapeeth has established five specialized research institutes in the areas of Health Related Sciences, Biotechnology, Information Technology, Applied Chemistry and Social Sciences.
        Dr. Patangrao Kadam subsequently expanded the scope of his activities and started many other institutions as its sister concerns. They include cooperative units of various kinds, several trusts, quite a few service institutions and even an orphanage..</p>
